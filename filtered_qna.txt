Q1: What is the purpose of dividing the remaining training data on each IoT device into support and query sets (St,P2 and Qt,P2)?
A1: The support set (St,P2) is used for local training on the IoT device, while the query set (Qt,P2) is used for evaluating the performance of the locally trained model. This split facilitates meta-learning by simulating few-shot learning scenarios.

Q2: What role does the global model (ϕr) play in the local training process on each IoT device?
A2: Each IoT device receives the current global model (ϕr) from the server and uses it as a starting point for its local training. The device then adapts this global model using its own local data.

Q3: What phase of the overall process does this text describe?
A3: This text describes Phase 2 of the process, which focuses on local training and evaluation of the model on each IoT device *after* an initial data allocation phase (Phase 1). It details how devices utilize their remaining data and the received global model.

Q1: What optimization algorithm is used to update the model weights locally on the IoT device in Fed-Meta-Align?
A1: The Adam optimizer is used for local weight updates. It’s applied sample-by-sample during training on the local support set, utilizing a local learning rate denoted as β.

Q2: How is the initial model weight (ϕt,0) defined for the local training process on each IoT device?
A2: The initial model weight (ϕt,0) is set to ϕr, representing the received model from the federated learning process. This means each device starts its local training from the globally shared model.

Q3: What type of learning paradigm is emphasized in the local training phase, given the TinyML context?
A3: The local training emphasizes online learning, specifically performing updates sample-by-sample. This is crucial for TinyML applications where resources are constrained and continuous adaptation is needed.

Q1: What is the purpose of the query set Qt,P2 in the Fed-Meta-Align process?
A1: The query set Qt,P2 is used by each IOT Device to *evaluate* the performance of its locally trained model (ˆϕr t) *after* updating it with local data. This evaluation helps gauge how well the model generalizes to unseen data on that device.

Q2: How is the query loss (LQ t) calculated, and what does it represent?
A2: LQ t is calculated as the average loss over all samples within the query set Qt,P2, using the loss function L. It represents the performance of the locally trained model on the device’s local query data.

Q3: What is a key difference in how IOT Devices contribute to the overall learning process, compared to standard Federated Learning?
A3: Unlike standard Federated Learning where weights are immediately sent, the text indicates IOT Devices do *not* immediately send the updated weights ˆϕr t. This suggests a contribution scoring mechanism is used *before* weight transmission, hinting at a more selective or nuanced aggregation process.

Q1: How does Fed-Meta-Align quantify the quality of an IoT device's update using the query loss (LQ)?
A1: Fed-Meta-Align transforms the query loss (LQ) into a 'query score' (st) using the formula st = 1 / (1 + LQ). A lower LQ results in a higher st, indicating a better, more confident update from the device.

Q2: What is the range of values for the query score (st) and what does this signify?
A2: The query score (st) is bounded between 0 and 1. This range represents the confidence level in the device's update, with values closer to 1 indicating higher confidence and better update quality.

Q3: Besides the quality of the update, what other aspect of the device's contribution does Fed-Meta-Align consider?
A3: Fed-Meta-Align also considers the *direction* of the weight update, represented by the "Weight Delta". While the text doesn't detail *how* this is computed, it indicates it's a key metric alongside the query score for intelligent aggregation.

Q1: What information does each IoT device transmit to the central server during the Federated Learning process in Fed-Meta-Align?
A1: Each IoT device transmits its weight delta (∆r<sup>t</sup>), representing the difference between updated and original global weights, *and* its query score (s<sup>t</sup>) to the central server. These are the key components for the server-side aggregation.

Q2: How is the weight delta (∆r<sup>t</sup>) calculated according to the provided text?
A2: The weight delta is calculated as the difference between the updated local weights (ˆϕ<sup>r</sup><sub>t</sub>) of a device and the original global weights (ϕ<sup>r</sup>). Essentially, it quantifies how much the local model has changed.

Q3: What is the primary function of the server after receiving data from the IoT devices in Fed-Meta-Align?
A3: The server performs a "similarity-aware aggregation" using the received weight deltas and query scores. This suggests the server doesn't simply average updates, but considers the relationships between devices during aggregation.

Q1: How does Fed-Meta-Align quantify the alignment of an individual IoT device's update with the global update trend?
A1: Fed-Meta-Align uses cosine similarity (θt) to measure alignment. It calculates the cosine of the angle between the device's update direction (∆rt) and the average update direction (¯∆r) across all devices.

Q2: What does a negative cosine similarity value (θt) signify in the context of Fed-Meta-Align?
A2: A negative cosine similarity indicates that the IoT device is updating its model in a direction *opposite* to the collective trend of the other devices. This suggests a potential conflict in learning.

Q3: What vectors are used to calculate the cosine similarity (θt) within the Fed-Meta-Align process?
A3: The cosine similarity is calculated using two vectors: the individual IoT device's update direction (∆rt) and the average update direction (¯∆r) computed by the server across all IoT devices.

Q1: How does the Fed-Meta-Align server determine the weight assigned to each IoT device?
A1: The server computes a weight for each IoT device by combining its query score (magnitude) and its directional alignment (similarity). This results in an unnormalized weight, reflecting both the strength and direction of the device's contribution.

Q2: What is the purpose of bounding the similarity term with a constant 'c' in Fed-Meta-Align?
A2: Bounding the similarity term prevents outlier IoT devices with significantly negative similarities from disproportionately hindering the learning process. A constant value of 0.1 is used, but can be tuned as a hyperparameter.

Q3: Is the similarity constant 'c' a fixed value, or does it require adjustment?
A3: The similarity constant 'c' is treated as a hyperparameter and is subject to tuning. Its optimal value depends on the specific dataset and the characteristics of the neural network being used.

Q1: What is the purpose of the weighting factor `wt = st × max(c, θt)` in the Fed-Meta-Align algorithm?
A1: This weighting factor scales the influence of each IoT device's update. `st` represents a device-specific scaling, and `max(c, θt)` ensures even devices with slightly different movement directions can contribute, albeit with reduced impact.

Q2: What does the 'similarity floor' parameter 'c' represent in Algorithm 3?
A2: The similarity floor 'c' acts as a threshold within the `max(c, θt)` function. It ensures a minimum scaling factor is applied, even if the similarity measure `θt` is low, allowing some contribution from all devices.

Q3: What is the initial model `w*` used for in Phase 2 of the Parallel Similarity-Aware FL algorithm?
A3: `w*` represents the meta-initialized model, obtained from a previous phase (likely meta-learning). It serves as the starting point for the parallel federated learning rounds in Phase 2, utilizing the IoT device data `Dt`.

Q1: What is the purpose of computing the 'query score' (st) in the Fed-Meta-Align process, and how is it calculated?
A1: The query score (st) acts as a measure of the local model's performance on unseen data (Qt,P2). It's calculated as the inverse of 1 plus the evaluation of the updated local model (ˆw(r)t) on the query set, effectively weighting devices based on their performance.

Q2: How does the server aggregate the model updates received from the IoT devices in Fed-Meta-Align?
A2: The server computes the *average delta* (¯∆(r)) of the model weight changes (∆(r)t) sent by each device. This average delta represents the collective update direction, rather than directly averaging the models themselves.

Q3: What information does each IoT device send to the server after local training?
A3: Each IoT device sends two pieces of information: the *weight delta* (∆(r)t), which represents the change in model weights after local training, and the *query score* (st), which indicates the performance of the updated model on a held-out query set.

Q1: How are the initial weights (wt) calculated before normalization in Fed-Meta-Align?
A1: The initial weights (wt) are computed by multiplying the similarity score (θt) – derived from cosine similarity between device and average deltas – by a scaling factor (st), and then taking the maximum of this product with a constant 'c'. This ensures non-negative weights.

Q2: What is the purpose of normalizing the weights (ˆwt) in the Fed-Meta-Align process?
A2: Normalizing the weights (ˆwt) ensures they sum to one. This is crucial for creating a proper weighted average when aggregating the model updates from different IoT devices, effectively representing their contribution to the global model.

Q3: How is the global model (w(r)) updated using the normalized weights and device deltas?
A3: The global model is updated by adding a step in the aggregated direction. This step size is determined by the learning rate (α) multiplied by the sum of each device's normalized weight (ˆwt) and its corresponding model delta (∆(r)t) across all devices (T).

Q1: What is the role of the 'rateα' and the update equation ϕr+1=ϕr+αX t∈Crˆwt∆r t in the federated learning process described?
A1: 'rateα' likely represents a learning rate controlling the step size during model updates. The equation describes how the model parameters (ϕ) are updated in each round (r+1) based on the weighted average of changes (∆r t) calculated from client updates (X t), using client weights (ˆwt).
